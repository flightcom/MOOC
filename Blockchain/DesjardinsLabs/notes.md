### Smart Contract theory

- it's a computer program
- high-level language
- compiled down to EVM
- pays gas fees only when calling a function changing the state of the blockchain

Types:
- boolean : True, False
- int/uint
- address
- Fixed-size bytes array (better to use it)
- bytes
- String

Custom Types:
- enum


Visibility
- external: accessible from outside only, part of contract interface
- public: accessible from outside, part of contract interface
- internal: only accessible internally, and in derived contracts
- private: only accessible internally, (not in derived contracts)


Payable functions
- contracts can hold ether

```
function myFunction public payable { }
```

Require()

```
function setUserAge(uint age) publi {
    require (age > 0);
    // contract is not executed if condition is not met
}
```
