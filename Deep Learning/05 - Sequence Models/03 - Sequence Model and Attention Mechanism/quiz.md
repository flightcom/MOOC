### 01

False

### 02

- Beam search will run more slowly.
- Beam search will use up more memory.
- Beam search will generally find better solutions (i.e. do a better job maximizing P(y|x))

### 03 

True

### 04

No, because P(y*|x) <= P(yË†|x)> indicates the error should be attributed to the RNN rather than to the search algorithm.

### 05

True

### 06

- We expect  to be generally larger for values of a<t'> that are highly relevant to the value the network should output for . (Note the indices in the superscripts.)
- (Note the summation is over t'.)

### 07

True

### 08

The input sequence length Tx is large

### 09

cookbook

### 10

Features of the audio (such as spectrogram features) at time t.
