# QUIZ

## 01
Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.

## 02
- We have access to a lot more computational power.
- We have access to a lot more data.
- Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.

## 03
- Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly.
- Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea.
- Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware).

## 04
False

## 05
Figure 3

## 06
False

## 07
False

## 08
- It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.
- It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).

## 09
x-axis is the amount of data
y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.

## 10
- Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
- Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
