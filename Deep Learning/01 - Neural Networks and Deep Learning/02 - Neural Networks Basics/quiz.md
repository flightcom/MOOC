## 01

A neuron computes a linear function (z = Wx + b) followed by an activation function

## 02

(i)(y^(i),y(i))=−(y(i)log(y^(i))+(1−y(i))log(1−y^(i)))

## 03

x = img.reshape((32*32*3,1))

## 04

c.shape = (2, 3)

## 05

c.shape = (4,2)

## 06

(nx,m)

## 07

c.shape = (12288, 45)

## 08

c = a + b

## 09

This will invoke broadcasting, so b is copied three times to become (3,3), and ∗ is an element-wise product so c.shape will be (3, 3)

## 10

J = (a - 1) * (b + c)

## Résultats

Faux: 5 - 8

## 05

The computation cannot happen because the sizes don't match. It's going to be "Error"!

## 08

c = a + b.T
