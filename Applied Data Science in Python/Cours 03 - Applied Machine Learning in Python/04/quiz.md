# QUIZ

## 1

Separate the data into distinct groups by similarity

## 2

Trees often require less preprocessing of data

## 3

To improve generalization by reducing correlation among the trees and making the model more robust to bias.

## 4

- Naive Bayes
- Neural Networks

## 5

- For having an audience interpret the fitted model, a support vector machine would be a better choice than a decision tree.
- For predicting future sales of a clothing line, Linear regression would be a better choice than a decision tree regressor.
- For a model that won’t overfit a training set, Naive Bayes would be a better choice than a decision tree.

## 6

Neural Network
KNN (k=1)
Decision Tree

## 7

accuracy2 = (3760 + 512 + 3408 + 72) / (3916 + 4208)
accuracy2 = 7752 / 8124
accuracy2 = 0.954

accuracy1 = (3796 + 3407) / 8124
accuracy1 = 0.887

diff = 0.954 - 0.887
diff = 0.067

## 8

- collection_status - Flag for payments in collections

## 9

- If time is a factor, remove any data related to the event of interest that doesn’t take place prior to the event.
- Remove variables that a model in production wouldn’t have access to
- Sanity check the model with an unseen validation set

## 10

x1  x2  output
0   0   0
0   1   1
1   0   1
1   1   0
