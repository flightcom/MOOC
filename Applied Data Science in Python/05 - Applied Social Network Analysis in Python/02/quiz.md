#### 02
Network (A) has lower average local clustering coefficient and lower transitivity than (B).
?

#### 03
- The radius of this network is half of its diameter.
- The deletion of node G will make the network disconnected.
- If we perform Breadth-First Search (BFS) from node A, the BFS tree we obtain will have a depth of 4.
- The eccentricity of node B and C are equal.

#### 04
- It is a disconnected graph with 2 connected components.
- If edge (E,G) is removed, the number of connected components will not change.
- We can make the graph connected by adding edge (E,J).

#### 05
- Only network (B) is a strongly connected graph.
- We only need to add one directed edge in order to change network (C) to a strongly connected graph.

#### 06
- The closure of an airport and the cancellation of a flight route are examples of two different kinds of network attacks in the real world.
- Network robustness measures a networkâ€™s ability to maintain its connectivity.
- Adding edges to a network can never make the network less robust.
