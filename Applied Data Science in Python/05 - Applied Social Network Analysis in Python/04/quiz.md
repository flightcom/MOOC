#### 03
- If we draw a power law distribution in log-log scale, the distribution will look like a straight line.
- The Preferential Attachment Model generates a network with a power law degree distribution.

#### 04
- The degree distribution of small-world networks follows power-law distribution.
- Some Small-world networks have high local clustering coefficient and small average shortest path.
- In the small-world model starting with k nearest neighbors, increasing the rewiring probability p generally decreases both the average clustering coefficient and average shortest path.

#### 05
Average local clustering coefficient will increase and average shortest path will decrease.
